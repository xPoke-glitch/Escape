## The Game

The objective is to escape from each room / level! Find the floor's ladders to escape to the next room.

Be careful, avoid guards or slay them if you find a sword in the floor. If a guard sees you, it will start to chase you! if you get caught you will lose a life and restart the level.

There is a nice tutorial scene in the project, I suggest you to follow it!

The game is not completed, it's just a prototype, but it has all the components to create as many levels as you want.

## Requirements

If you only want to run the game and play:
* Windows 64bit

If you want to open, edit or see the Unity project:

## How to play

In order to play the game you have two options:
